Objective: Built a U-Net-based segmentation model to identify and segment humans in images, aiming to enhance image processing and computer vision capabilities.
Tools and Technologies: PyTorch, segmentation_models_pytorch, Albumentations, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and NumPy.
Key Responsibilities:
Processed and prepared a custom human segmentation dataset using Python and Pandas.
Implemented data augmentation techniques with Albumentations to enhance model generalization.
Developed a PyTorch-based custom dataset class for efficient data loading.
Evaluated performance using combined loss functions (Dice Loss and Binary Cross-Entropy) and optimized model parameters using Adam optimizer.
Achieved model evaluation through rigorous training and validation cycles, saving the best model based on validation loss.
